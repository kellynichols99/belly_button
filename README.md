# From Bacteria to Beef

<h1>Belly Button Biodiversity!</h1>
We worked to identify the best way to best convey the data to Roza's volunteers and other researchers using Plotly. For volunteers who are interested in selling their bacteria to Improbable Beef, what is the best way to visualize the types of bacteria that colonize their bellies? Some of them will be suitable for synthetic beef production, while others will not. Specifically, we identified the top 10 bacterial species in volunteers’ belly buttons while tracking the number of times they wash in a week and the volume of the bacteria. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

<h1>Summary</h1>

<h3> Horizontal Bar Chart</h3>
<p>We created a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) from an individual’s ID when it is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. <p>

<h3>Bubble Chart Showing Bacteria Cultures</h3>
<p>Here we used the volunteer data to identify a wider range of bacteria IDs and created a bubble chart to help visuallize the volume and variety of the bacteria. </p>

<h3> Gauge Chart</h3>
<p>Finally we added a gauge chart to show the number of the times a week that the volunteer washes the area.</p>

<h1>Challange Summary</h1>
As you can see we have created an interactive and specific web page that allows Roza's volunteers and fellow researchers to see the most recent bacterial data for each volunteer. We focued on being able to identify both speciifc and a wide range of information in one location and page interaction. This is all done in a viaual way that has created a more engaging page. Check out some of the results!
